# finiteElementCode
**Best practice for clean code**
- Language should be english for everything (variables, classes, folders, files, comments etc.).
- Write complete names for variables, classes, folders, files etc. with convention: 
  - First letter of first name should be written in lower case. First letter of (second, third etc) joined words should be capitalized.
  - Example >> parameterMaterialNu = 3; (not like >> paramnu = 3;)
- Do not duplicate code (minimalism)!
- A function should do one thing, and only one thing (modularity)!
